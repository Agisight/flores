# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

In particular:

1. Any updates to pre-existing files shall entail a major version bump.
2. The inclusion of a new language, without changes to other pre-existing data, shall only entail a minor version bump.

It follows from the above that benchmark scores across different releases of FLORES+ with the same major version number are comparable.
